                This is my first webpage. In the beginning, it was hard, but when I stopped and paid attention, it became easier. 
                I approached each problem by breaking it down into smaller parts, which made things less overwhelming. Whenever I got stuck, I asked my professor for help. 
                I made sure to double-check my code for errors and typos before submitting. Overall, this assignment helped me gain confidence with HTML and showed me the value of taking things step by step. Looking forward to the next challenge.
