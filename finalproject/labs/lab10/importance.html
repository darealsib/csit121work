        <h2>Why the Web Share API Matters</h2>

        <p>
            The Web Share API makes sharing easier and more familiar. Instead of using custom share 
            button a site can open the phone’s native share menu with 
            one tap. Users already know how their device’s share menu works, so it feels natural.
        </p>

        <p>
            It also removes the need for outside share scripts that slow websites down or track users. 
            Because the device handles everything locally, sharing is faster, cleaner, and more private.
        </p>

        <p>
            Quick sharing also helps websites grow. When users can share something easily, they’re more 
            likely to spread it to friends or social apps.
