  <h2>Reflection</h2>

  <p>This project helped me put everything for the class in one place. I had to go back through each lab, check the files, and make sure the links still worked. Keeping the design simple made it easier for me to line things up and not get lost.</p>

  <p>I tested the site in more than one browser and also on my phone. On the phone, the layout changes with the media query so the text stacks and the nav is easier to tap. That showed me why it matters to test on a small screen and not just on a laptop.</p>

  <p>Overall, CSIT 121 taught me the basics of HTML and CSS, like headings, lists, tables, images, and simple page structure. I feel more comfortable editing code, fixing small mistakes, and putting together a basic website on my own.</p>
