  <h2>Reflection</h2>

  <p>This project helped me put all my work in one place. I kept everything simple so it would be easy to read and navigate. It also helped me stay organized and check that all my links worked.</p>

  <p>I tested the site on different browsers and on my phone. On mobile, the layout changed with the media query, which made it easier to use. It showed me why checking on a small screen matters.</p>

  <p>This class taught me the basics of HTML and CSS. I learned how to structure pages, add images and tables, and build small multi-page websites. I feel more comfortable writing basic code now.</p>
