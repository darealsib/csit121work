      <h2>Reflection #1 (lab02)</h2>
      <p>This is my first webpage. In the beginning, it was hard, but when I stopped and paid attention, it became easier.
      I approached each problem by breaking it down into smaller parts. Whenever I got stuck, I asked my professor for help.
      I made sure to double-check my code for typos. Overall, this assignment helped me gain confidence with HTML.</p>

      <h2>Reflection #2 (lab03)</h2>
      <p>Since lab02, I learned how to use CSS to style my webpage. I practiced class and ID selectors. I also got better at
      organizing my code and making sure it validates. Uploading my project to GitHub showed me how version control works.
      Iâ€™m looking forward to learning more.</p>
